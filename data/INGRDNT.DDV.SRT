1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Then I found out the other ingredients

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
HEY! HOW ARE WE DOING ON TEARS?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
20 gallons an hour boss

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WHATTTTTT? 

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ZAT IS NOT NEAR ENOUGH!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ZE FINE RICH FLAVOUR? ZE SMOOTH WITHOUT BEING BITTER?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PICK OUT ZE BONES!

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
It ain't my fault boss! We keep running out of Mudokons. They keep dissapearing

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
I DON'T NEED EXCUSES! I NEED TEARS

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
TURN UP THE GAUGE! DO IT!

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm on it boss

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
First our meat, then our bones, now our tears!

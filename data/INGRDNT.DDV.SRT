1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Then I found out the other ingredients

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
20 gallons an hour boss

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WHATTTTTT? 

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ZAT IS NOT NEAR ENOUGH!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ZE FINE RICH FLAVOUR?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ZE SMOOTH WITHOUT BEING BITTER?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PICK OUT ZE BONES!

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
It ain't my fault boss! We keep running out of Mudokons

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
They keep dissapearing

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
I DON'T NEED EXCUSES! I NEED TEARS

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
First our meat, then our bones, now our tears!

Open source implementation of ALIVE engine that powers Oddworld Abes Oddysee and Oddworld Abes Exoddus. 

This engine will be designed to allow easier modding than the orignal engine and for more extensive and complex AI. For example it should be possible to allow Sligs to use lifts and have interaction between Scrabs and Paramites.
